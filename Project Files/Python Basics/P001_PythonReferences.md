### Glossary

Glossary
- variable: A name that refers to a value.
- assignment: A statement that assigns a value to a variable.
- state diagram: A graphical representation of a set of variables and the values they refer to.
- keyword: A reserved word that is used to parse a program; you cannot use keywords like
if , def , and while as variable names.
- operand: One of the values on which an operator operates.
- expression: A combination of variables, operators, and values that represents a single re-
sult.
- evaluate: To simplify an expression by performing the operations in order to yield a single
value.
- statement: A section of code that represents a command or action. So far, the statements
we have seen are assignments and print statements.
- execute: To run a statement and do what it says.
- interactive mode: A way of using the Python interpreter by typing code at the prompt.
- script mode: A way of using the Python interpreter to read code from a script and run it.
- script: A program stored in a file.
- order of operations: Rules governing the order in which expressions involving multiple
operators and operands are evaluated.
- concatenate: To join two operands end-to-end.
- comment: Information in a program that is meant for other programmers (or anyone read-
ing the source code) and has no effect on the execution of the program.
syntax error: An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse (and therefore im-
possible to interpret).
- exception: An error that is detected while the program is running.
- semantics: The meaning of a program.
- semantic error: An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the
programmer intended.
